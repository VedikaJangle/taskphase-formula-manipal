The questions given for the task are :

1.	Write a program to determine if the sum of three user-input integers is even or odd as well as if the number is prime or composite.
2.	Create a program that converts seconds into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds. 
3.	Create a program to calculate electricity bills based on usage slabs (e.g.if total units are 350 then 0–100 units: ₹5/unit, 101–300 units: ₹8/unit, ₹10/unit for units above 300, then total bill is of 350 units is 2900). 
4.	Create a program to simulate a simple login system with 3 attempts to enter the correct password. 
5.	Create a program to remove all duplicates from an array of integers. 
6.	Implement a program count the number of vowels and consonants in the given string as well as to scramble the characters of a string randomly.
7.	Write a program to find the second-largest element in an array using pointers.
8.	Develop a program to swap every two adjacent elements in an array using pointers. 
9.	Take each element of the 4x4 matrix from the user and print it, then add each element from the 4x4 matrix and print the sum, print the sum of both the diagonals
10.	Implement Bubble sort or Selection sort on an array based on the input from the user and on the sorted array perform binary search algorithm to find an element
11.	Write a program that accepts n products' details and calculates and displays the total value of the inventory (i.e., quantity * price). Find the product with the highest quantity and the product with the highest Price and display their details. 
    Create a structure to represent a product in an inventory. The structure should include:
    Product ID (integer)
    Product Name (string)
    Quantity (integer)
    Price (float)
12.	Write a C program to print equilateral triangle or Pyramid star pattern series of n rows using. For eg n=5.

13.	Write a program to read a file and count the number of characters, words, and lines in a file.
14.	Create a recursive function to find the nth term of the Fibonacci series.
15.	Implement a recursive function to compress a string by replacing consecutive duplicate characters with their count (e.g., aaabbc becomes a3b2c1).
